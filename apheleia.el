;;; Commentary:

;; Apheleia is an Emacs Lisp package which allows you to reformat a
;; buffer without moving point. This solves the usual problem of
;; running a tool like Prettier or Black on `before-save-hook', namely
;; that it resets point to the beginning of the buffer. Apheleia
;; maintains the position of point relative to its surrounding text
;; even if the buffer is modified by the reformatting.

;; Please see https://github.com/raxod502/apheleia for more information.

;;; Code:

(require 'apheleia-core)
